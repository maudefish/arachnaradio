notes for future selves to keep track of which loose ends still need tying.

wednesday april 23

- finished pushing refactor
- wrote backfilling tool for parsed events
- fixed bugs in writing timestamp to parsed events + reversed order
- updated to python 3.11
- FEAT: entire transcription logging with boolean flags


todo:
- for some reason user venues are getting erased

## event map:
- filter events that have already happened / duplicates (save first mention maybe, in line with notification approach)
- IF venue date is missing --> go into master transcript log and search for relevant flags in nearby clips

	|--> implies that i should also start working on a concatenated transcription module

(also Yoshi's was mentioned and it didn't flag the venue -- need to fix aliases)

(also didn't catch this bottom of the hill mention? [00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.860]   I will do the question after I tell you what the the tickets are to the bottom
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.120]   of the hill over in San Francisco 1233 17th Street in San Francisco and it is a
🗣 Speech detected — checking for artist or venue mentions...

thursday april 24

[x] - fixed clean_transcript to ACTUALLY merge together chunks and remove timestamps 
[x] - logging cleaned transcripts now also -- will make concatenating easy in future
[x] - starting to address alias matching again -- AFTER LLM in pipeline

------------

[x] - a HUGE mess with the alias and fuzzy matching finally up and working...
[x] - alias + fuzzy matching applied to every transcript for venue lookup, then again after llm gets its hands on it (and occasionally screws it up). but no more!

[x] - TODO: handoff venue hint to LLM helper (see how far this gets up in terms of accurate venue matching... if a ton of dates are still missing etc then may need to develop method to looking to clips before and after for dates / other info). 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

saturday april 26

[x] - added a dev review page on the streamline dashboard for easy viewing of daily transcript logs. 
[x] - CURRENTLY: working on bug where fuzzy matching is not being called successfully in main pipeline

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sunday april 27

[x] - still working on fixing fuzzy matching -- problem was that the fuzzy matching was being attempted with the ENTIRE transcript. 
	- FIX TO IMPLEMENT: only attempt fuzzy matching in the form "... at VENUE, we have ..." and "VENUE has..."

[x] - OTHER PROBLEM: LLM (ollama) taking 30+ seconds to resolve transcripts from larger 90s clips. 
	- FIX TO IMPLEMENT: hand off only one venue match at a time. will then make process for searching beyond current clip for date/artist easier as well. 



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

saturday may 3

[x] created "fuzzy_matcher.py" to 1) identify potential phrases that may contain venue names (after "at" or before "has") and 2) run fuzzy matching against the a normalized list of known venue names. 

[ ] working on a geotagger (venue_geo_checker.py)

Sunday may 4

[ ] PROBLEM: while testing fuzzy matching on a test clip, 'the Rickshaw Stop' , (and sometimes SFJAZZ Center??? not getting same results on each run..) being listed as potential fuzzy match candidates even though they were already identified as direct string matches in venue_hits...... this implies to me that there must be something wrong with the way that pre-existing matches are removed from the candidate pool for fuzzy_hits. *** this must be fixed so that the list of fuzzy candidate phrases are clean to be manually combed through and either 1) added as a new alias for an existing venue (streamlit -> yaml), 2) added as a new venue (streamlit -> geopy -> yaml), or 3) ignored. 

[ ] could be wise to take a look at normalize_name() and normalize_name2() and make sure they are serving their roles properly -- removing "of" and "the" seems to increase effectiveness of fuzzy matching a LOT, but need to make sure the canonical names are still the ones that are logged. 

[ ] ALSO need to make sure that only venues within X miles of station are being looked at

saturday may 10

just thinking out loud... i'm thinking about my current pipeline specifically for searching for venues mentions. currently it looks like 

clip_processor --> check_for_mentioned_venues in venue_mention_logger --> normalize_name in alias_resolver --> back to clip_processor --> check for fuzzy....

maybe i should refactor this into a more modular approach. the general problem would be "find mentions of <string> in <transcript> by any means necessary. potential methods: direct, alias, fuzzy"


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX YET:

[ ] - artist names getting messed up (google api search + grab first corrected result if not in list? how slow will it be to constantly check for artists, even without fuzzy matching?)
	- possible fix: direct substring matching first (pre filter) -> fuzzy / alias matching when part of substring matches. (note that fuzzy matching for every artist is not feasible)

[ ] - clip size optimization / music detection: how to use the fewest possible amount of ACRcloud API calls possible while still getting all the song matches?

[ ] - user taste matching: could be pretty simple actually. because i imagine that just showing trending artists on a station may be too disorganized (different DJ will play totally different stuff), may be better to just make a metric for 1) songs played on station by user's favorite artists 2) mentions of artists get extra weight
