you did a lot of good work last night. 

- finished pushing refactor
- wrote backfilling tool for parsed events
- fixed bugs in writing timestamp to parsed events + reversed order
- updated to python 3.11
- FEAT: entire transcription logging with boolean flags


todo:
- for some reason user venues are getting erased

## event map:
- filter events that have already happened / duplicates (save first mention maybe, in line with notification approach)
- IF venue date is missing --> go into master transcript log and search for relevant flags in nearby clips

	|--> implies that i should also start working on a concatenated transcription module

(also Yoshi's was mentioned and it didn't flag the venue -- need to fix aliases)

(also didn't catch this bottom of the hill mention? [00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.860]   I will do the question after I tell you what the the tickets are to the bottom
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.120]   of the hill over in San Francisco 1233 17th Street in San Francisco and it is a

thursday april 24

- fixed clean_transcript to ACTUALLY merge together chunks and remove timestamps 
- logging cleaned transcripts now also -- will make concatenating easy in future
- starting to address alias matching again -- AFTER LLM in pipeline

------------

- a HUGE mess with the alias and fuzzy matching finally up and working...
- alias + fuzzy matching applied to every transcript for venue lookup, then again after llm gets its hands on it (and occasionally screws it up). but no more!

- TODO: handoff venue hint to LLM helper (see how far this gets up in terms of accurate venue matching... if a ton of dates are still missing etc then may need to develop method to looking to clips before and after for dates / other info).
