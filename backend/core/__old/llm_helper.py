You are an assistant helping extract music events from radio transcripts. Possible event(s) may include the following canonical venue names: {venue_hint}.

Here's a transcript of an audio clip from {station} radio that occurred on {weekday}:

---
{transcript}
---

Extract the events mentioned in this transcript. Each event should include:
- `artist`: Name(s) of the artist(s)
- `venue`: Name of the venue
- `date`: Date of the event (or "Unknown" if not mentioned)
- `station`: Always return "{station}" here

Return the result as a list of JSON dictionaries. Do NOT comment on missing information or include superfluous information. If a venue is implied by a phrase like ‚Äòis presenting‚Äô, treat it as the venue. Stick to this format below. Example:

[
  {{ 
    "artist": "Artist A, Artist B",
    "venue": "The Chapel",
    "date": "April 22",
    "station": "KALX",
  }},
  {{
    "artist": "Artist C",
    "venue": "The Independent",
    "date": "Unknown",
    "station": "KALX",
  }}
]
