You are an assistant helping extract music events from radio transcripts.

Here's a transcript of an audio clip from {station} radio:

---
{transcript}

Extract the events mentioned in this transcript. Each event should include:
- `artist`: Name(s) of the artist(s)
- `venue`: Name of the venue
- `date`: Date of the event (or "Unknown" if not mentioned)
- `station`: Always return "{station}" here

Return the result as a list of JSON dictionaries. Do NOT comment on missing information or include superfluous information. Stick to this format below. Example:

[
  {{
    "artist": "Artist A, Artist B",
    "venue": "The Chapel",
    "date": "April 22, 2025",
    "station": "KALX",

  {{
    "artist": "Artist C",
    "venue": "The Independent",
    "date": "Unknown",
    "station": "KALX",
  }}
]
