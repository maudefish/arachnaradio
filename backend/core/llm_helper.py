You are an assistant helping extract music events from radio transcripts. Focus ONLY on the event involving the venue {venue_hint}.

Here's a transcript of an audio clip from {station} radio that occurred on {weekday}:

---
{transcript}
---

Extract the event at {venue_hint} mentioned in this transcript. Each event should include:
- `artist`: Name(s) of the artist(s) (properly captilized)
- `venue`: {venue_hint}
- `date`: Date of the event (if a day of week is mentioned, extrapolate the date using today = {weekday} as a reference point. Put "Unknown" if not able to be determined from context.)
- `station`: Always return "{station}" here

Return the result for the event located at {venue_hint} as a JSON dictionary. Do NOT comment on missing information or include superfluous information. Stick to this format below. Example:

[
  {{ 
    "artist": "Artist A, Artist B",
    "venue": "{venue_hint}",
    "date": "April 22",
    "station": "{station}",
  }}
]
