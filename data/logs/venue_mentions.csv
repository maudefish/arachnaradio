That is ""Hailey 4"" from Circuit to Zoo. Circuit to Zoo performed over at the chapel this past weekend last Sunday. It was an absolutely, spectacularly beautiful concert, one of the most powerful that I've been to of the year so far and I think will definitely be on the list when we start compiling them in December of one of my favorite live experiences of the year 2025. But I had a chance to have a conversation with her before that show happened. So we have in the offing today around half an hour of a conversation about the project Circuit to Zoo, about various other projects that she has, some for collaborators, the process of making her brand new record, which is called ""Halo on the Inside"".

The answer is, I say, ""Fucktruck."" In case you didn't catch it, that was from the album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, the track Poor Places by Wilco. Wilco is one of my favorite bands of all time, and I do think Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is probably my favorite album of all time.

And someone did say, ""This record is a big stinker,"" which, when it was released in 2002, they thought it was a big stinker. And I think it's funny that now, I guess, 23 years later, the perception of this album is definitely not that at all.",37.808,-122.2708

Heather Cox Richardson is a professor of 19th century American history at Boston College and has become widely known for her daily chronicles, Letters from an American. Dylan Penengrath is an associate dean of the program in jurisprudence and social policy at UC Berkeley's Law School where he focuses on African American and legal history. This is part one of a two-part series with part two airing on May 13th at 9am right here on 90.7 KALX. I want to ask you just a really simple beginning question. You started Letters from an American in 2019. What has changed since 2019 about your experience, not about the country. Your experience of writing letters. When I started writing the letters, of course I didn't intend to start writing the letters at all.

So that is what you just heard. You are listening to KALX Berkeley. It's 22 minutes after three. I got off to a little late start, but thank you so much and see you later to DJ Pacifica. Great having you with us here at KALX. Students graduate and they move on, but Elisa remains. The mission of First Place for Youth is to help foster youth build the skills they need to make a successful transition to self-sufficiency and responsible adulthood. So if that set of music got you in the fields and you're wondering what you can do to help, you can learn more about how you can get involved with assisting foster youth by visiting this organization on their website, FirstPlaceForYouth.org. We have the entertainment calendar coming up at 3.30 if you're looking for something to do tonight, but we have a couple more songs before that. Next one is also a bummer song, but it might be exciting for you because it is the first original recording in five years from Fiona Apple. It just came out. A little background on this track. It's called ""Pre-trial,"" and since Fiona Apple put out her 2020 album, she's been busy being a court watcher in Prince George's County in Maryland, which brought her face to face with the American justice system. And she's watched, I guess, thousands of trials, and it's been shocking for Fiona",37.8257804,-122.26967135

We heard before that a group called Alcazar and a track they call ""Kissesil Isa"" which was a really 100% good cover of ""Personal Jesus"" and Alcazar is from Lisbon, Portugal. It's a collective that was started by producer Thomas Attar and he brought together musicians from four continents to make that record and the vocalist on that particular track is named Sibel. Before Alcazar we had ""Go"" by Tones on Tail and we started that set of music with something from the new record by Maitran and Zangaman. The song is called 8-9-3-2-1-6-8. If you know, you know and I definitely don't know but the new album is called ""Congregate"". And Maitran is a Polish producer named Jasek Janoweski and Zangaman is a Japanese producer named Susuma Mukai and that song is super cool, I hope you enjoyed it.

Visitors of all ages are invited to sit, stand, drift, and explore the labyrinthine chapel, with each listener creating an individual program from among the concurrent performances. This year's event is June 21st, from 5 to 9 p.m. And information on location, transportation, and tickets can be found at GardenOfMemory.com. That's GardenOfMemory.com. And if you haven't ever been to that event, it is truly a once-a-year, extremely unique only in Oakland, only in the East Bay event. So I would encourage you to check out GardenOfMemory.com and join a lot of the Calyx people who will be wandering around the Chapel of the Chimes this solstice. It is one minute after four o'clock. You are listening to KALX Berkeley. We're broadcasting from the University of California. We're going to send out this next set to Ronnie and Tim.

But unfortunately, her day is filled with way, way, way too many things. And it would have been a two-four appearance on the station because she is going to be coming in to talk to film close-ups about the film at the beginning of the hour. The 5.30 to 6.30 time slot she's going to be on from 5.30 to 6 talking about the film and probably also talking about her history with Calyx. But at any rate, I did want to shout out the film a little bit and let people know that it's there in case you might miss the film close-ups broadcast tonight. I want to get the word out there as much as I possibly can. Again, 40 watts from nowhere is the name of the film, which deals with pirate radio, also has a cat name, which was always a good sign. And you can go to theroxy.com and find out information about it that way. And you can also go to sfindy.com, I believe it is, which is the umbrella film festival under which the San Francisco documentary film festival resides.

Who would have ever thought that would happen, right? And then I discovered that there was all this vintage footage of the station from 1998, and I never thought I was going to be a filmmaker, but when you're a journalist and when you're presented with all this amazing footage, I was like, how hard could it be? And then you found out. Yes, I did. That's interesting because, I mean, the first thing that I thought of watching the film was she knew she was going to do this because there is so much interview footage and sort of documentary evidence of the station, of KBLT. Yeah, and it was not me. It was one of the DJs had bought one of these early digital video cameras and he started shooting thinking that he was going to make a documentary. And then I think once he shot all that footage, he was like already exhausted. So he just put it in a shoebox and put it in his garage and then happened to find it and was ready to throw it out. And instead he just reached out to me. Well, thank God he did. Yes, that's my thought as well. We should say that the film ""Forty Fox from Nowhere"" documents the very short lifespan, which it's interesting to me. I think one of the quotes in the film is that really important things have short lifespans. So I'm paraphrasing that. Yes. But I think it was only around a three-year stretch that KBLT existed, correct? Yeah, almost exactly. So the first station",37.808,-122.2708

But just let them know what was at stake and like please do not be saying these words if you can help it. Please do not advertise. 'Cause I know that a lot of stations in Florida were taking paid advertising and that got stations busted. So I was just trying to protect the station and still let DJs have their freedom, but also let them know like I don't, this could bring us down. - Don't wear a flag too high above the paradise. - Yeah, yeah, like don't just be super in your face, like that's not the point of this. - Right, mm-hmm. - You know, it wasn't about, you know, just telling the man to f off. It wasn't, you know, it was really about trying to create community and let people have a space to be creative with their music. - Which, I mean, that's the thing that I think, I mean, this film to me kind of is in the mold of something like Turn It Around, which is about the Berkeley punk scene, or the Aquarius Records documentary. I mean, it's sort of capturing these moments where you have sort of these focal points where like-a-winded weirdos come together and sort of, and also the fact that all of these things, you know, Gilman Street and Aquarius and KBLT and all of these other sort of points radiate out and actually are hitting people that you don't, you will never see and never know.",37.879307,-122.297145

The fact that the Bay Area had KFJC, KUSF, and Calix is kind of the big triangle of really amazing stations. KXSF, as nice as it is, isn't the same thing somehow because it's not broadcasting over the airwaves. It's not a terrestrial station. So yeah, that's definitely something that may too, maybe someone else might seem a piddling, trifling kind of distinction, but there is a visceral difference there. - I think so. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think it's like big R romantic FM radio. - Yes, uh-huh, yes, uh-huh. If you have just joined us, speaking of FCC legality, you're listening to KALX Berkeley 90.7 FM, which is another thing that I noticed that the people at KBLT did, which if people aren't familiar with legal IDs at the top of the hour, KBLT, huge to that, it seemed. - I think that's because people who are DJing the station grew up listening to radio, so they sort of know how radio works. It wasn't like I told people, listen, when it gets to be noon, you need to be saying this, and we need to do three minutes of whatever. I think that's just because that's how people grew up, and they understood that that's sort of how you do it. It was all of us pretending to be real radio. - Look at us, look Ma, no hands.

Well, I'm presuming that this film is a little bit of an offshoot off of cat daddies. But I'm wondering if we could maybe just start by talking about encountering the whole notion of international cat rescue and how the two of you encountered each other and the, I guess, the initial German ideas for this film. Yeah, I was traveling around a few years ago with my film Cat Daddies, documentary about men who love cats. And, you know, whenever I go to another city, a new city, I check out the cat cafe there. And so I met Katie there, and she also came to my screening there, too. And so, of course, we hit it off for cat ladies. But, you know, later on, I learned about the cat rescue, international rescue she was doing at the cafe. And what struck me was that I, you know, had heard, we all heard about international cat rescue, pet rescue from other countries, but it's usually a large organization. And they usually like charter a plane. And, you know, there's a lot of fundraising. And, you know, it's usually sort of, you know, getting them out of a disaster or conflict area. Taylor Swift's private jet can take that. Yeah, but we never I never heard of someone just going over there and picking up 25 cats and bringing them back on a commercial flight. So it's kind of like,",37.7667182,-122.43054460123211

If I could bring 300 cats, I would, but the infrastructure isn't there. So in a certain sense, yes, I would love to be able to bring all these cats with me, but reality kind of puts its foot down at a certain point. Right. You only have so many resources to help. And it really must be the best fit. The personality must be right, the health of the cat must be right. It's a long journey. There's, I just went into, there's a cat cafe in the Mission that I'd sort of, I'd walked past a number of times, and I finally went in for the first time, maybe two or three weeks ago. It's called Kit Tea. I heard about it, yeah. And so I went there sort of right towards closing, so I was basically there pretty much by myself. When I walk in, and I think within five seconds, there was a cat in my shoulders. So it's that kind of thing that, you know, these are the cats, which will immediately go up to you and say, Yep, I have no fear of people at all, I'm coming right there. Right. So I can certainly see the importance of, adopt me, look at me, I'm a personable cat. The goal is adoption, yep. So when I'm picking cats, like we mentioned in the movie, that the goal is adoption. You know, and the more cats that we get adopted, the more we can help. Right. Although there is a person who works at the station who fosters a lot of cats.

And the significant thing, at least for us here at the station, for people who have been long, long, long time listeners of Women Who Love Half the Sky, you might remember Sue Carpenter produced this program back in '94, '95, thereabouts. And we were trying to see if we could get her schedule today to come in so that she could come and maybe just do a little bit of deejaying on the program to sort of go back to her roots, as it were. But unfortunately, her day is filled with way, way, way too many things. And it would have been a two-four appearance on the station because she is going to be coming in to talk to film close-ups about the film at the beginning of the hour, the 5.30 to 6.30 time slot she's going to be on from 5.30 to 6, talking about the film, and probably also talking about her history with Calyx. But at any rate, I did want to shout out the film a little bit and let people know that it's there in case you might miss the film close-ups broadcast tonight. I want to get the word out there as much as I possibly can. Again, ""40 Waltz from Nowhere"" is the name of the film, which deals with pirate radio, also has a cat name, which was always a good sign.

I feel like I have to be excited about a song and what it's doing on its own, in addition to whether there's a really cool drum part or bass part or something. I think that's kind of what inspires me, but it is kind of scary also stripping down a song for a set like this. Some of those songs I've never played solo before, so I had to practice earlier and be like, ""Oh wait, there's a solo, what do I do here?""

But the Saints are actually coming and the Saints are going to be playing at Great American Music Hall in San Francisco this November. And sometimes I'm not sure how I feel about the bands that don't have the original members and I kind of judge them on their intentions and all those kind of nuances, but it might be good. And I think the singer is Mark Arm. So it would be challenging for me to enjoy ""The Saints"" without the vocals of Chris Bailey, but Mark Arm might be a person who's up to the job. So if you're a Saints fan, letting you know that the Saints are indeed coming. And the song we heard by Ed Cooper and Jim White was a Saints song called ""Swing for the Crime."" It's from their new record together called ""After the Flood."" Guitarist Ed Cooper of ""The Saints,"" of course. And drummer Jim White is in ""The Dirty Three,"" among others. I really enjoyed hearing Jim White's drumming on that track. I might have to go revisit some more tracks from that album.

And it was just powerful, it was moving, it was about identity, it was about blackness, about femininity, it was about society, it was about fun, it was about joy, it was about so many things. And you know, just thinking about being here in the Bay Area, it's so great to be able to commune with each other through the power of art and music. I agree, and I enjoy communing with you right now on the radio through the airwaves. It's Calyx, and I'm Desolation Girl.",37.7759904,-122.42047537588324

I really like this song Suspended, which we're just getting ready for this. We haven't performed it live yet, so getting ready for this tour, so we'll do it for these shows. I'm really into swarm. New songs are really fun to play live, and we'll also play some old songs too, everywhere in the tools. Yeah. Is it just yourselves touring this music, or are there folks joining you on tour to bring the sound to life? Right now, it's just the two of us, which has been really cool to see how big a world of sound we can bring with just the two of us. Yes. We aim to shock and awe with our world of sound. How are those two people doing all of those things? Yeah. We don't have computers on stage. We try to really use, I mean, other than the tiny computer in the sampler that I sometimes use. But yeah, we do a lot pretty analog, which I've always been really proud of. You guys are great. Thank you so much for your time.
