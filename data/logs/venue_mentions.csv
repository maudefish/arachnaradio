That is ""Hailey 4"" from Circuit to Zoo. Circuit to Zoo performed over at the chapel this past weekend last Sunday. It was an absolutely, spectacularly beautiful concert, one of the most powerful that I've been to of the year so far and I think will definitely be on the list when we start compiling them in December of one of my favorite live experiences of the year 2025. But I had a chance to have a conversation with her before that show happened. So we have in the offing today around half an hour of a conversation about the project Circuit to Zoo, about various other projects that she has, some for collaborators, the process of making her brand new record, which is called ""Halo on the Inside"".

Anyway, thanks for that. That was an absolutely marvelous way to tip Saturday into the long, slow slide of Sunday, which is where we find ourselves now.

The answer is, I say, ""Fucktruck."" In case you didn't catch it, that was from the album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, the track Poor Places by Wilco. Wilco is one of my favorite bands of all time, and I do think Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is probably my favorite album of all time. And I think the really fun thing about Calyx is that from the moment these albums are released, this one in 2002, you can see what people had to think about it. And someone did say, ""This record is a big stinker,"" which, when it was released in 2002, they thought it was a big stinker. And I think it's funny that now, I guess, 23 years later, the perception of this album is definitely not that at all.",37.808,-122.2708
