Power restored to Spain and Portugal after Monday's blackout. Now for some local news. Last Monday, April 21st, the City of Berkeley implemented a hiring freeze for the next fiscal year in the face of a budget deficit of almost $27 million. Berkeley City Manager Paul Buddenhagen announced that the city will shut down hiring with limited exceptions through the summer of 2026. The 2026 general budget fund adopted by the council last year projected expenditures of $296 million, but current projections anticipate expenditures of $316 million. This overshoot is likely a result of increased salaries and overtime pay, a decrease in expected savings and the 134 vacant positions that were factored into the budget. The city hopes this hiring freeze will help them evaluate which job vacancies should not be factored into the general fund budget to reduce expenditure costs, according to Birkleyside. Berkeley Mayor Adina Ishi shared, ""We're doing everything we can to make sure we can",Red Sea

That was the Chinese musician Wu Man playing a pipa, which is a Chinese plucked lute that has been played in one form or another for at least 2,000 years, with a traditional piece called ""Ambush from Ten Sides."" For this piece, she played a pipa that was from late Ming and/or early Qing dynasty. It had been restored. And she's got a fascinating new album out called ""Seeking the Tao of Strings."" There are 13 pieces on it, and for each one, she chooses a different pipa based on the time that it was made and the song itself. Really marvelous, marvelous work there from Wu Man. And prior to that, it was Richard Carr with his new one, ""The Leap."" And he performed on the violin, the piano, and electronics along with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Vladimir Martinka. And we heard ""The Leap No. 5,"" ""Mid-Air Regrets.""

I just played you a very long jam by Comets on Fire called Blue Tomb from their Blue Cathedral album that was their sub-pop debut, uh, I believe after that. That was after they were on Alternative Tentacles, Bay Area label, for a little while. Before that I played Internet by All Them Witches from Sleeping Through the War on New West Records. That came out in 2017 or 18 or so, uh, which was a weird time in my life cause I was spending most of my time pushing papers in an office.

Once upon a time, in Magical Pony Land, there was a little pony named Sparkle Motion who had a dream. I have a dream! She wanted to be a radio DJ. DJ! But there was a problem. Two problems. Big ones. The first is that the only jobs were in the glitter industry. Or the glue factory. Because Magical Pony Land was not a diversified economy. So that's a bummer. And the second one was... Darn clumpy hooves! Yeah, you need hands to DJ. Sparkle Motion was very sad and she cried tears, which turned into jelly beans. Green ones. Which is another one of those totally annoying things that just happens in Magical Pony Land. When suddenly... Sparkle Motion! I'm here to grant your dearest wish!",Broadcast

And the significant thing, at least for us here at the station, for people who have been long, long, long time listeners of Women Who Love Half the Sky, you might remember Sue Carpenter produced this program back in '94, '95, thereabouts. And we were trying to see if we could get her schedule today to come in so that she could come and maybe just do a little bit of deejaying on the program to sort of go back to her roots, as it were. But unfortunately, her day is filled with way, way, way too many things. And it would have been a two-four appearance on the station because she is going to be coming in to talk to film close-ups about the film at the beginning of the hour, the 5.30 to 6.30 time slot she's going to be on from 5.30 to 6, talking about the film, and probably also talking about her history with Calyx. But at any rate, I did want to shout out the film a little bit and let people know that it's there in case you might miss the film close-ups broadcast tonight. I want to get the word out there as much as I possibly can. Again, ""40 Waltz from Nowhere"" is the name of the film, which deals with pirate radio, also has a cat name, which was always a good sign.

Honestly, it's kind of like, um, I don't know, it's kind of a little bit like a wedding song, almost, but, uh, that's the B-side, and it's amazing, an amazing song, I think. The A-side is probably more famous, Les Souquettes, or the Lollipop. You've probably heard, Les Souquettes, but, um, actually, I like the B-side better, so, uh, Les Souquettes, sorry, uh, the Lollipop, written by France Galle, and, um, no, written by Serge Gonsberg, and sung by France Galle, and, um, pretty scandalous at the time, in the, uh, 1965-ish, '66, '67. Oh, I should just play Les Souquettes, and then I could talk about it. Instead of talking about a song they didn't play. So the one I played was ""Con ton n'et en sambre"". Pre-singing that was, ""Tini Yonge"" with ""Mon futur et in Montpass.",Sorry

Maybe this is too much information, but I'm only just like getting used to French possessive pronouns or yeah, possessive pronouns or possessive adjectives. I think it's actually possessive adjectives, ""ta me d'el de morre,"" which are not like English. In English, it's just ""your."" Everything is ""your,"" but in French, everything changes depending on the gender. So everything in French has to agree in number and in gender with the noun. So I'm just getting a handle on it.

Space Heads is a duo of trumpet and drums based in Manchester and London. They formed in the early 1990s and they've been regularly releasing music over 30 years so thanks to Absolutely Kosher for repackaging that for our pleasure. We had in there Nazar from his new record Demilitarize where he's reckoning with mortality and the flowering of new love motivating that album of his which is heavily influenced by his experience with and during COVID. Nazar did the song War Game and we heard KVB with their track Deep End. All of this can be found on our playlist of course it's at calyx.berkeley.edu. It's also song by song on the front page of our website and it's also maybe on your car dashboard if you have the right software in there.

On this record he he drummed on ""How Big Is The Rainbow"" and he totally transformed I think that you know I was kind of like I don't want to say bored with the song but I was like the sneeze to be you know like we we don't just do speaking of mainstream we don't just do like four on the floor club music I'm saying just with quotes it's it's really actually hard to do four on the floor club music but there was something that didn't feel us and um and he really brought this this the bridge alive and then Nate took Danielle's drumming and then and filtered it through a synthesizer so that you're getting this this different texture of that of these very organic drums with this digital sound so I would say um for me it's about about this constantly evolving relationship with the music that you're studying and I think the same is for you know the same goes for jazz too that there are these traditions that you you have to go all the way in to study deeply and then and then to figure out where we as white musicians we as american musicians like where do we fit into this and how do we how do we be responsible with this knowledge that we've been gifted and sort of along those lines you mentioned your work with Boots Riley and with the Alma Virgo and Sorry To Bother You scores is that sort of scoring work and and being in that space is that something that sort of came natural to you or it's it's a different hat and a different space that you sort of have to go into.",Sorry

That's a great question. For me, it was when we were square and sorry to bother you, I had this experience where I was playing some arpeggiated synthesizers for the elevator scene, and I was like, ""Oh, this is like my calling. This is exactly what I should be doing with my life,"" and both musically and also like supporting someone else's like vision, because musically, which is in a way, it's like similar with Meryl, where I'm not writing the lyrics, but I'm kind of like helping someone who has this like amazing concept to help create the music to sort of get it out into the world. So it felt like very natural, especially as someone who's like not the main singer, not the main lyricist, just sort of like that, almost like an accompaniment role. And that being said, I probably had the hardest time with that. And I felt the same way. I felt like, ""Oh my gosh, I want to do this forever."" There's something so incredible making music for someone else's visual masterpiece. And for me, it was a switching of roles that I'm not the one in charge, making the decisions and having the last call. So I humbly say to you, Nate, that's been a growing edge for me.

Very cool. Yeah, again, I've had the experience of talking to a couple of musicians who have sort of found their way into that scoring composition side of things, and I get a sense that it's very sort of evolutionary, both in a camp that you can sort of go to and sort of try out some things, as well as ways that it applies back to kind of your core concept of music. Are there foundational cinematic scores or even just like rhythms or ""soundtracks"" to your life or music that you encounter on sort of like a, again, sort of a soundtrack to your life and sort of going through the world that are influential or signature to who you are or how you go about your days? Whoa, man. Sorry. No, no, that's such a deep question. I'm like, ""What is the soundtrack to my life?"" My answer is probably different because I feel like as a singer and as someone who's really trying to care for my voice differently in my 40s, that I honestly, I have to like sing a lot during the day. I have to hum a lot and, you know, like vocalize basically and make stupid dumb noises so much of the day that if I'm being honest, I think it's like my own voice is the subject of my life much of the time.

I think you can see how organizing your brain like this can be very helpful. We're getting to the fears. I hate this part. Oh boy. Oh spiders, man. I hate spiders. That one really gets me. Oh brother. I wish we could get rid of that one. Phew. I'm glad that's over with. At least there's an advantage to lumping all your fears together so they don't get mixed up with other things.

That's a little fear I must have gotten out of place somehow. I'm sorry about that, but here's a cottage where we spent some where some mixed up there. Well, there's the high school when I was...
