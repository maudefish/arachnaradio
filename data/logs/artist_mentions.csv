The main thing I do in life is playing guitar and I really like the way that she like Nick Drake or Joni Mitchell like she finds different tuning systems and it's every song is a secret right. It's like anti what could work right like kick drum like what we say in French like ""Abrutissant"" was like something that stays within you. It's so soulful and if you're like willing to create your own stuff and commit to it you still have like a chance to make it.
