Power restored to Spain and Portugal after Monday's blackout. Now for some local news. Last Monday, April 21st, the City of Berkeley implemented a hiring freeze for the next fiscal year in the face of a budget deficit of almost $27 million. Berkeley City Manager Paul Buddenhagen announced that the city will shut down hiring with limited exceptions through the summer of 2026. The 2026 general budget fund adopted by the council last year projected expenditures of $296 million, but current projections anticipate expenditures of $316 million. This overshoot is likely a result of increased salaries and overtime pay, a decrease in expected savings and the 134 vacant positions that were factored into the budget. The city hopes this hiring freeze will help them evaluate which job vacancies should not be factored into the general fund budget to reduce expenditure costs, according to Birkleyside. Berkeley Mayor Adina Ishi shared, ""We're doing everything we can to make sure we can",Red Sea

That was the Chinese musician Wu Man playing a pipa, which is a Chinese plucked lute that has been played in one form or another for at least 2,000 years, with a traditional piece called ""Ambush from Ten Sides."" For this piece, she played a pipa that was from late Ming and/or early Qing dynasty. It had been restored. And she's got a fascinating new album out called ""Seeking the Tao of Strings."" There are 13 pieces on it, and for each one, she chooses a different pipa based on the time that it was made and the song itself. Really marvelous, marvelous work there from Wu Man. And prior to that, it was Richard Carr with his new one, ""The Leap."" And he performed on the violin, the piano, and electronics along with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Vladimir Martinka. And we heard ""The Leap No. 5,"" ""Mid-Air Regrets.""
